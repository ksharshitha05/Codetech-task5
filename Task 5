Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics
Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset
Tool: Python (Scikit-learn)
 Step 1: Import Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix
 Step 2: Load the Dataset
data = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")   # use correct file name
 Step 3: Separate Features and Target
X = data.drop("target", axis=1)   # features
y = data["target"]                # label
 Step 4: Split Data into Train & Test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
Purpose:
Training data → used to train the model
Testing data → used to check model performance on unseen data
 Step 5: Train Logistic Regression Model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
 Step 6: Predict on Test Data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
 Step 7: Calculate Evaluation Metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
 Step 8: Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
Confusion Matrix Explanation:
True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted disease
True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted no disease
False Positive (FP): Predicted disease but no disease
False Negative (FN): Missed disease prediction
 Step 9: Interpret Results 
The Logistic Regression model was trained using training data and evaluated on test data.
Accuracy shows overall correctness of the model.
Precision indicates how many predicted positives are actually correct.
Recall shows how many actual positives are correctly identified.
The confusion matrix helps understand correct and incorrect predictions.
Final Outcome
This task helps understand:
Train vs Test split
Model training
Evaluation metrics
Confusion matrix interpretation
