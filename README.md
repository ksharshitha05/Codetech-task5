Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics
 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand how to split a dataset into training and testing sets, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance using different evaluation metrics.
 Tools Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
 Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)
The dataset contains patient health information and a target column indicating the presence of heart disease.
 Steps Performed
Loaded the Heart Disease dataset using Pandas.
Separated features and target variable.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train-test split.
Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
Predicted results on the test data.
Evaluated the model using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
Generated and analyzed the confusion matrix.
 Evaluation Metrics Explanation
Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Measures how many predicted positive cases are actually positive.
Recall: Measures how many actual positive cases are correctly identified.
Confusion Matrix: Shows correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.
 Result & Interpretation
The Logistic Regression model was successfully trained and evaluated.
The evaluation metrics indicate that the model performs well in predicting heart disease.
The confusion matrix provides insight into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
 Final Outcome
This task helped in understanding:
Importance of train-test split
Model training and prediction
Model evaluation using different metrics# Codetech-task5
